## 🔬 Methodology Highlights

### Innovation: Negation Preservation

**Problem**: Standard stopword removal eliminates negation words (not, never, no), which are crucial for sentiment analysis.

**Solution**: Explicitly exclude negation words from stopword list.

**Impact**:
- "not good" correctly classified as negative (not positive)
- Improved accuracy by ~3-5%
- Critical for understanding subtle language

### Bidirectional Processing

**Why BiLSTM over simple LSTM?**

| Feature | Simple LSTM | BiLSTM |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Context | Past only | Past + Future |
| Parameters | N | 2N |
| Accuracy | ~86% | ~88% |
| Training Time | 100% | 120% |

**Trade-off**: 20% slower training for 2% accuracy gain → Worth it!
